# Magic Mirror Report 

**Important:**

- Was unable to implement draggable icons
---
### Mirror Design
- Time and weather are located in the top left.
- Relevant health information related to sleep is below the clock.
- A button to change the lighting is on the bottom left.
- Newsfeed and Daily Info such as your schedule are located on the right side of the mirror.

### Advance Features
- One advanced feature is being able to change the lighting of the mirror.
- An original advanced feature I thought up was to show the remaining energy a user may have.
- The rested amount is the remaining energy of the user based on how much time is left in a 16 hour day.
- The 16 hour day is derived from sleeping for 8 hours a day and being awake for the remainder.
